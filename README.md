# Scrounger

A webapp that finds free food on campus using club emails. It gives the location and time of where and when the food will be served.

Backend is done with Django v1.11 and SQLite3 to store the times and locations.

Frontend will be done with ReactJS and Bootstrap4 to show better visuals and smooth interactivity.

Googlemaps will be used to show where you are on the map and the path you need to take to get to the food.
